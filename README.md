# Curriculum Vitae
- Project analysis, User profile: One of the user profile could be a recruiter from a tech company that is looking for a computer science student.

- Project analysis, Information architecture: 
I organized my resume website to make it easy for recruiters to find all the important information quickly. I set up a sidebar on the left with my basic details, like my contact info, languages I speak, programming skills, and main abilities. This sidebar stays in one place, so you can always see my key info without scrolling. It’s like a summary of my profile that gives recruiters a quick idea of my background and skills.

On the right side, I divided the main area into sections: 'About Me,' 'Education,' 'Work Experience,' and 'Projects'.The 'About Me' section gives a short introduction about my studies, goals, and strengths. Then, I listed my education and work experience, with the most recent ones at the top, so it’s easy to see my background at a glance. In the 'Projects' section, I added descriptions and preview images for each project I’ve worked on, which helps show my practical skills and the kind of work I’ve done.

In summary, the layout is simple and organized, which makes it easy to follow and understand. Each section flows naturally, so recruiters can quickly find what they’re looking for and get a clear idea of my profile.

- Project analysis, Visual design: 
For the visual design of my resume website, I wanted it to feel organized and straightforward, similar to how a printed resume looks. I divided the layout into two main parts: a sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right. The sidebar has all the essential information, like my contact details, language skills, programming languages, and personal skills. I've tried to create the effect of one sheet of paper layered over another.

On the right side, I organized everything into clear sections like 'About Me,' 'Education,' 'Work Experience,' and 'Projects.' Each section is labeled with a bold header, making it easy to find what you’re looking for. In the 'Projects' section, I created cards for each project. Each card has a picture, title, date, and a short description. This setup gives a quick overview of my work in a way that’s visually appealing and easy to read. The cards add some variety to the page and let people quickly understand each project without getting lost in text.

Overall, I designed the layout to feel familiar, like a physical resume, where everything has a specific place and flows logically. This way, the website looks clean, professional, and easy to navigate, making it convenient for recruiters to find all the important details quickly.
